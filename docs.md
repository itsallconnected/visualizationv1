# AI Alignment Visualization Platform Documentation

## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1 System Overview
The AI Alignment Visualization Platform is a comprehensive tool designed to visualize and manage complex hierarchical relationships within AI alignment concepts. It provides an interactive, graph-based visualization that allows users to explore, discover, and understand the intricate connections between various components in the AI alignment ecosystem.

This platform uses a GitHub-based architecture, storing all visualization data directly in a GitHub repository as SHA-512 encrypted files. This approach enables version control, collaboration, and straightforward deployment via AWS Amplify without requiring a traditional backend server, while ensuring robust content protection.

### 1.2 Intended Audience
This documentation is intended for:
- **Viewers**: Users who need to browse and understand AI alignment visualizations
- **Contributors**: Users who create and edit content within the visualization
- **Moderators**: Users who review and approve content changes
- **Administrators**: Users who manage the platform, user permissions, and system settings
- **Developers**: Technical users who need to extend or modify the platform

### 1.3 Key Concepts

#### 1.3.1 Node Hierarchy
The visualization is structured as a hierarchical network with ten levels of node types:

1. **Component Group** (Level 0): Top-level categories (e.g., AI Alignment)
2. **Component** (Level 1): Major categories (e.g., Technical Safeguards)
3. **Subcomponent** (Level 2): Specific approaches (e.g., Interpretability Tools)
4. **Capability** (Level 3): Functional areas within a Subcomponent
5. **Function** (Level 4): Specific functions within a Capability
6. **Specification** (Level 5): Detailed implementations of a Function
7. **Integration** (Level 6): System integration approaches
8. **Technique** (Level 7): Specific techniques for an Integration
9. **Application** (Level 8): Practical applications of a Technique
10. **Input/Output** (Level 9): Data flows for an Application

#### 1.3.2 Content Protection
The platform includes a robust encryption system that allows sensitive content to be protected with passwords. Different parts of a node can have different encryption levels:
- **Basic Information**: Node name, type, and relationships (visible to all viewers)
- **Detailed Content**: In-depth descriptions (requires decryption or user based access)
- **Full Content**: Complete node data including sensitive information (restricted access)

#### 1.3.3 Multi-Sphere Visualization
The system supports multiple visualization "spheres" that can exist independently or connect to each other. Each sphere represents a separate network of nodes, allowing for organization of content into distinct domains while still enabling cross-sphere relationships.

### 1.4 System Requirements

#### 1.4.1 Browser Requirements
The visualization platform works best with:
- Chrome 80 or higher
- Firefox 75 or higher
- Safari 13 or higher
- Edge 80 or higher

WebGL support is required for the 3D visualization.

#### 1.4.2 Device Requirements
- Desktop/Laptop: Recommended for best experience
- Tablet: Supported with limited functionality
- Mobile: Basic viewing supported, editing not recommended
- Minimum 4GB RAM recommended for larger visualizations

### 1.5 Accessing the Platform

#### 1.5.1 URL and Initial Access
The platform can be accessed at the deployment URL provided by your administrator. Upon first visit, you'll see the main visualization with basic content visible.

#### 1.5.2 Anonymous vs. Authenticated Access
- **Anonymous Users**: Can view only the level 0 node and are prompted to login. As soon as they are logged in, they can see the basic visualization.
- **Authenticated Users**: Can access additional features based on their assigned role. They can decrypt different nodes based on receiving passwords and they stay decrypted for these users permanently or time based (if the moderators or administrators lock the user out of the node or time-based node access runs out)

#### 1.5.3 GitHub Integration
The platform uses GitHub for authentication and data storage:
1. All visualization data is stored in SHA-512 encrypted files in a GitHub repository
2. User authentication is handled through GitHub OAuth
3. Content access and editing permissions are linked to GitHub repository permission, but encryption and decryption is handled by the code itself and passwords are not stored, rather the local PC capability is used to decrypt the content based on the scripts. 

### 1.6 Platform Layout

#### 1.6.1 Main Interface Components
The platform interface consists of:
- **Navigation Sidebar**: Access different views and different skins of models and different tools and panels based on user-type
- **Visualization Container**: The main 3D (optionally choosable by a user a 2D display) area for the node network
- **Details Panel**: Shows information about selected nodes
- **Controls Toolbar**: Tools for interacting with the visualization
- **Breadcrumb Trail**: Hierarchical navigation path
- **User Menu**: Account settings and authentication options

#### 1.6.2 Navigation
Users can navigate the visualization by:
- **Zooming**: Scroll wheel or pinch gesture
- **Panning**: Click and drag (or touch and drag on mobile)
- **Rotating**: Right-click and drag (or three-finger drag on mobile)

## 2. User Authentication and Access Control

### 2.1 Authentication System Overview

#### 2.1.1 GitHub OAuth Integration
The AI Alignment Visualization Platform uses GitHub OAuth for authentication:
- No separate user accounts need to be created
- Users authenticate with their existing GitHub credentials
- Authentication tokens are securely stored and automatically refreshed
- Repository permissions determine base access level

#### 2.1.2 Authentication vs. Authorization
- **Authentication**: Verifies user identity through GitHub OAuth
- **Authorization**: Determines what actions a user can perform based on their assigned role

#### 2.1.3 Session Management
- Sessions are maintained for a configurable time period (default: 60 minutes)
- Optional automatic session refresh when user is active
- Sessions can be manually terminated via the user menu

### 2.2 Account Management

#### 2.2.1 Login Process
1. Click the "Login" button in the top-right corner of the platform
2. You will be redirected to GitHub's authentication page
3. If you're already logged into GitHub, you may be automatically authenticated
4. If not, enter your GitHub credentials
5. Review and authorize the requested permissions
6. Upon successful authentication, you'll be redirected back to the platform
7. Your name and avatar (from GitHub) will appear in the user menu

#### 2.2.2 Registration Process
Since the platform uses GitHub OAuth, there is no separate registration process:
1. If you don't have a GitHub account, create one at [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Visit the website again and now login with your GitHub account
3. You will be automatically added to the repository, you can login as described above
4. New users are typically assigned the "Viewer" role by default

#### 2.2.3 Forgotten Password
If you forget your GitHub password:

2. Profile information (name, email, avatar) is synchronized from GitHub
3. Role assignments and platform-specific settings can be viewed here
4. To update basic information (name, email, avatar), make changes on GitHub

#### 2.2.5 Session Timeout and Security
